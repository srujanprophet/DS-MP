# DS-MP

# Question : 
  Construct at least five heaps of size varying from 100 to 2000 filling with random numbers. Measure efficiency as the
  number of data moves in order to build the heap. Analyze the performance of the heaps while construction and produce
  a comparison report in the form of a graph.

# Approach :
  The C file contains source code.
  The arrays files contains test arrays of varying sizes. ( For lack of knowledge in using csv files in C ).
